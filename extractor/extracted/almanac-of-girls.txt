  - We formulate here the Eugenics Manifest. I don't want you to get the wrong idea. This has nothing to do with barbaric experiments of antiquity. When girls are spawned some are born with terrible diseases that fill them with misery, that turn their caretakers lives into a living hell.
  - Picking feathers from the floor, cleaning their shit off the walls, keeping them from eating their tiny soft fingers or plucking their antennae off which will never grow back and make them even more insane, helping a girl with gills and shriveled legs into the water every day, knowing you'll have to support them forever? That they'll never grow up, never be self-sufficient?
  - Can you really say a retarded child is happy? Have you heard their voices?
  - Civilization is crumbling because girls are born that cannot contribute. Each of us must do the work of three when two are in bed. How can we compete with the enemies of Girlswampwar?
  - If I had to list the most regressive qualities a person could have...I would have to say {shk}{print mutation1}{print mutation2}{shk}

  - I'm part of a faction that no longer believes in direct attack on the _girls. This goes against the principles of AestheticProgress. Instead, we practice absolute expansion. The fortressy will expand to fill the world, reducing the possibilities outside it.
  - the WorldFortressy will not necessarily look like a structure of stone and bronze. We have seen the failures of the past. How many of the crumbling structures you see in Girlswampwar territory were once citadels? instead it will be shops, houses, streets, schools. the nature of the fortressy will be woven into public life as finely as thread. this thread will be so long that it cannot be unraveled. the thread will be composed of finer threads, and those threads will be connected to every other thread, and the threads will be morgellonic in their persistence, in their compassionate endurance.
  - Physical capital will be replaced by social capital. There will be no weapons to count, no dead to enumerate, only the perpetual tuning of neurology through social micro-checks.

  - Olivia Heat Death {printTile "tarot1"} is using her Impossible Catechism deck against Tambourine Hectare's {printTile "tarot2"} Dream of Silence. This will be a meta-defining tournament.
  - Dream of Silence relies on quick papercuts and the low sterility of the environment to exploit the opponent's low immune system. That's why the dance club is such a key choice of arena, with all its sex germs. Olivia Heat Death wanted to fight in the sand pit but she lost the coin flip.
  - Impossible Catechism tries to stall the game until the final bell. Then it unleashes a paradoxical and risky combo!
  - Dream of Silence has never been defeated. Some say it's the Ultimate Deck. But Olivia Heat Death's surprise return could upset that. Everyone thought she was killed in her battle against Orchid Flesh...10 gigaturns ago. Orchid's final card went straight through Olivia's neckmeat. They said she was dead and buried. Guess you can't stop a master of DEMON TAROT. Or can you? Jeez...
  - Dream of Silence is about having zero answers and blindly rushing the win condition. Impossible Catechism is about having all answers but no field presence. Truly fascinating.
  - Did she just play "Broken Mirror"? I can't bear to watch...their decks are going to catch on fire...someone stop it...please...
  - If Olivia Heat Death can't draw the right card she'll absorb the full entropic power of Dream of Silence's Origami Paperweight. If you position that card in the triadic sphere, it deals infinity damage. *she repeats "infinity damage" in an increasingly morose tone*

  - My name is Riesling Acesulfame. Is that what you wanted to know? It's sad when girls like you don't even have names so you want to know other girls names.
  - I'm sorry. That was rude. I'm just on edge...
  - I'm sure you'll get a name someday. It's not easy to sift through like, every possibility in the universe and decide which you're going to brand to your skin.
  - Why am I nervous...well...don't tell anyone...if you do I'll pop your head like a grapegirl. Heheh just kidding.
    Or am i...
  - OK so. I'm a pukeshine runner. But I don't take the swamp paths. Very dangerous if you don't know the way. Instead I take the train. The greatest deception is the most blatant, wouldn't you say?
  - Where do I hide the pukeshine? My spacious cloaca.
  - jk lol!! You totally fell for it. Bwahaha!
  - I stick the pukeshine to the bottom of the train with slime that I milk from my girlfriend. I have to jerk her real good to get it nice and thick...slimegirl consistency really fluctuates...
  - The hardest part is figuring out which part of her slimy chaos is conceptually her asshole. Sometimes there's none, or a hundred. It's a rough analogy, of course...what I'm describing is far more sophisticated than the average asshole.
  - Maybe I shouldn't be telling you all this...but I get the feeling you won't be alive long anyways.

  - You play {print card1} in reverse orientation, making your soul invulnerable for a single turn. This costs all your psychoplasma, leaving you with nothing else to do but pass.

  - NO!! You close your eyes and BELIEVE. You reach out your hand and place it on your deck and grit your teeth. Small intestine of the cards, baby...
