       It Moves On Despite                                       You are an experienced Captain in Her Majesty's Folent Army, traveling from the Capital to Redtock in order to aid in battle there. You stop to rest at a military camp about 80 miles away from the city; it seems this camp is a popular resting spot for traveling Folent civilians.
